# RemoteBlue
RemoteBlue is a simple android application that allows you to control your bluetooth enabled windows device to be controlled from a distance
It is based on a simple client-server architecture and the target machine (The device you wish to control) must have a server that listens to the requests made by the client  (The Android App)
The app has many features including keyboard control, mouse control, music control (independent of the music player on the target device), File Browser (Will display all the files if you have hard drives named C: and D:), Presentation control. The app also acts as a remote that can be used to Lock, Hibernate, Shutdown or Restart your Windows Device. 
The Server Application is available here
